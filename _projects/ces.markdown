My first visit to CES (Consumer Electronics Show) was a blast, so many interesting companies showing off their coolest tech. With over 4,000 exhibitors and over 2 million square feet of exhibition space, the CES mobile app was helpful in getting around and knowing when and where events were happening. That being said, I saw several places where the CES app could be improved and this proposal aids to improve the app experience for the years to come.

I wanted to take full advantage of the topic categories created for CES. As such I created a color system that maps each category to a color for identifying events, booths and several other things across the app experience.

## Process

The web experience and mobile app experience are quite disconnected. I found the web experience to offer cleaner interactions and a cleaner interface and wanted to capture some of it for my redesign, while maintaining the full featured nature of the mobile app.

Some interaction and static interfaces, that I used as inspiration. Looking at things like ease of use, hierarchy and legibility to name a few.
