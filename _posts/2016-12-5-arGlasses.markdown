How did this project come to be? One of my courses had asked us to do a quick project with the idea of using a motion capture system to track a "tool". We struggled for a bit trying to figure out just how to use the capture software and read out the maker points. The first thing was just setting up and calibrating the sensors to make sure the points were accurately captured in the space. After setting it up we were ready to make our tool using a rigid body rig, which is 3 tracking markers that hold position between them at all times during the recording. Once we had our tool we were ready to record our motion path. 

As part of this project we were given a Grasshopper script in order to pull the motion tracking data into Rhino 3D. Both of us not being familiar with Grasshopper us just started to play around with the given script. Quickly we found that the capture stream was coming a bite sized bits which gave us unintentionally small shapes, single arcs or segments rather than the whole drawing. You could say this was a happy accident of not knowing exactly what we were doing, we definitely did and ran with it. I wanted to create something unique given these micro motions and decided to take the movement and create a 2D drawing and pattern, given a particular view and several different sizes of the motion. Once I had created the image I noticed it could be neat tessellated and then though wouldnâ€™t it be cool printed at a couple different scales and used a fun unique gestural wrapping paper!
