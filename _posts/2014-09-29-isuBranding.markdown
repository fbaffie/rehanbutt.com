## Process

When starting this project I looked at what words described the International Student Union and what we do as an organization. I came up with the following: diverse, connected, global, community, social and fun.

![Inspiration / Research](../img/ISU/ISUinspiration.png)
![Iteration 1](../img/ISU/ISUiteration1.png)
![Iteration 2](../img/ISU/ISUiteration2.png)
![Iteration 3](../img/ISU/ISUiteration3.png)
![Iteration 4](../img/ISU/ISUiteration4.png)
![Iteration 5](../img/ISU/ISUiteration5.png)
![Iteration 6](../img/ISU/ISUiteration5.png)

These are the iterations I created for the brand image. Using different shapes and segments using five components as a symbol for the five inhabited continents. Looking at flag patterns and golden rectangles as one structure generating the logo.

![Text Iteration](../img/ISU/ISUcolorText1.png)
![Color Iteration](../img/ISU/ISUcolorText2.png)

This was the first high fidelity logo I came up with. Looking at text positioning relative to the logo and color as the next step in the process.


![Logo V1](../img/ISU/ISUlogoV1.png){: .image-center style="width:60%"}

After this logo I realized that the color worked as it was bright and as orange is a secondary color it incorporated several components, while the logo itself had no relation to any of the terms I had compiled, diverse, connected, global, community, social and fun.

![Iteration 7](../img/ISU/ISUiteration7.png)
![Iteration 8](../img/ISU/ISUiteration8.png)

I used the idea of interlocked circles similar to that of the olympic rings as a new direction or pattern for a more conceptually centered logo.

![Color Iteration](../img/ISU/ISUweaveColor.png)
![Overlay Iteration](../img/ISU/ISUweavePattern.png)

This led me to the final logo. Where I then looked into a color palette for each of the four segments. After I decided on the colors I looked into how the segments would tie in to one another. At the end I went with this color pattern and the half overlapped segments.

![Poster Design](../img/ISU/ISUposter.png){: .image-center style="width:40%"}

Using this new brand image I created a poster for one of our events.
